<h2 id="c1"><span class="large">Practical Skunk Raising.</span></h2>
<p class="center">By William E. Pratt.</p>
<p>The supply of wild fur has already fallen
behind the demand and the time is in sight
when wild fur will form but a small per cent
of that in use.</p>
<p>All furs trapped in steel traps are less
beautiful because the animal suffers. It is
a well-known fact that the less the animal
suffers, the better the fur.</p>
<p>The time is not far away when nearly all
fur will be grown on fur-ranches. Fur-farming
unquestionably has a great future
as an industry.</p>
<p>Without detailing countless failures; it is
well to begin by disposing of the wrong idea
that most people begin with, that all they
need to do is secure an island or a big
fenced area, and throw in much feed to a
bunch of selected fur-bearers, and reap a
harvest of so many pelts each year.</p>
<p>The absurdity of this is seen if we compare
it to a horse-breeder who would put a
high fence around a large pasture and turn
in a couple stallions and a dozen mares;
throw in much feed daily, and expect a harvest
of so many colts, each year.</p>
<p>No,&mdash;success depends on general supervision
and control of each individual.</p>
<p>Skunks raise a better coat in captivity than
when wild, because their food is gotten without
hunting for it, and are beyond danger
of man, dogs, and other intruders. Striped
skunks ten years ago sold for one dollar per
pair, while only two dollars per pair was
paid for &ldquo;star blacks&rdquo;. Three years ago or
more these prices had doubled, and a skunk
with his scent glands out was even more
valuable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>One male and two females is a good lot
to begin with, which would increase to
twenty young the first year, and one hundred
and fifty the second, providing one
could wait that long, and one certainly
could not expect any dividend until the fifth
year.</p>
<h2 id="c2">2.&mdash;The Ground.</h2>
<p>An acre of ground is sufficient to begin
with, but one must have it situated so one
could increase to perhaps ten acres. It
should be high, dry and sandy, with some
grass in the plot, and not too remote from
a railway station.</p>
<h2 id="c3">3.&mdash;The Fence.</h2>
<p>An inexpensive fence to begin with may
be made by setting posts in the ground close
together, but strongly. I recommend a fence
made of wire netting or steel set or inbedded
in the ground from one to two feet.
First, dig a trench about one foot wide and
two feet deep, and put heavy rock in the
bottom and thus, with the rock below the
wire there will be no way that the skunks
can escape by digging.</p>
<p>The posts should be set ten feet apart. If
set farther the wire will have a tendency to
sag. The wire should be of one and a half
inch mesh for the main fence, and one inch
mesh for the breeding yards, as young
skunks sometimes escape through a one
and a half inch mesh. No. 16, or 18,
gauge wire from four to eight feet in height
should be used. Any smaller gauge than
the above mentioned is not durable enough.</p>
<p>A wire or board inhang of twelve inches,
should be placed at the top rejecting in so
the animals can&rsquo;t climb out. This is attached
by slats nailed along the tops of the
posts and the wire nailed to them. Steel
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
sheeting needs no inhang, because it is so
that the skunks cannot get a foothold.</p>
<p>If the skunks dig at night to get out fill
up the holes as soon as possible and thus
discourage the workers.</p>
<p>The big pen or large enclosure, serves as
a range for the barren females, males, and
young skunks during autumn.</p>
<h2 id="c4">4.&mdash;Pens.</h2>
<p>Many breeders consider pens better and
cheaper than dens. These are little runs
about ten feet square, separated only by a
three foot netting which has an inhang or
overhang as it is some times called, of a
foot on each side, so the skunks cannot
climb in or out. If boards are used for
pens inside the big fence no overhang is
needed. All pens should be completely
floored with mesh wire three or four inches
under surface.</p>
<h2 id="c5">5.&mdash;Dens.</h2>
<p>Every cage or pen needs a movable den
that is dry, sanitary, portable, easy for observation,
and warm. This last feature is
important, for skunks are sensitive to cold
which causes pneumonia. The dens should
be well supplied with straw and rags, (avoid
hay) because the seeds are injurious to the
nostrils.</p>
<h2 id="c6">6.&mdash;Cage Litter.</h2>
<p>After trying smooth floored dens, and
floors strewn with straw, chips, ashes and
sawdust; I feel safe in recommending sawdust,
as its great absorbent power helps
to keep clean dens. It should cover the
floor to a depth of two inches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c7">7.&mdash;Food Troughs.</h2>
<p>Do not use wooden troughs; they are
unsanitary. Pie dishes either tin or ware,
will do if the sides do not flare. If they do
the skunk usually spills the milk or any
liquid in the dish, by standing on the sides
with its paws.</p>
<h2 id="c8">8.&mdash;Food House.</h2>
<p>The food and tool-house should be in the
pen for convenience. There should be mice
and rat-proof vessels to keep the oatmeal
and dry biscuit, cheese, and meat in. It
should be equipped with a large boiler for
boiling oatmeal and meat in. The meat
may also be smoked as this will preserve it,
and is greatly preferred by the animals.
The meat may be hung out of reach of the
rats in sacks.</p>
<h2 id="c9">9.&mdash;Feeding.</h2>
<p>Skunks like most animals are omnivorous.
A continuous unbroken diet of meat would
eventually wipe out the stock; as would a
diet solely vegetable. Moderate varied feeding
is essential. Adult skunks are fed once
a day, they themselves prefer it after dark.
Staple articles of food are beef, rabbit, cow
liver, chicken giblets, oatmeal, and other
porridge, cooked potatoes and milk; anything
a dog will eat with fruit and insects
added. Be sure the meat is clear of infection.</p>
<p>Another staple article of food is a bread
made of bran and shorts. Mix with three
quarts of sour milk, enough flour to make a
stiff dough. Roll dough out until it is an
inch thick and bake for an hour like bread
in a hot oven.</p>
<p>This is much relished by all fur-bearing
animals, and is still more acceptable if
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
flavored with a few spoonfuls of black
molasses.</p>
<p>Milk must be given sparingly unless it
agrees with the stock. Once a week is
enough, more than that is liable to induce
scouring and other disorders. Half a dog
biscuit, and a few scraps of meat are enough
for a skunk&rsquo;s daily allowance. Of course
some should have more than others according
to their needs.</p>
<p>A brood-mother growing or suckling her
young should have as much as she can eat
twice a day, morning and evening.</p>
<p>When winter comes, skunks retire to their
dens and eat nothing for weeks. In March
the feeding is resumed and in April the
brood mothers are extra fed with a preponderance
of meat, much of it raw. It costs
from twenty-five cents to a dollar to feed a
skunk from June first to December first.
Meat and fresh water are necessary at all
times for brood-mothers, for if this is neglected
they will devour the young as soon
as born.</p>
<h2 id="c10">10.&mdash;Water Troughs.</h2>
<p>Skunks drink much, and often. They
must have plenty of fresh water at all
times; especially when the young are expected.
The vessel that the water at all
times is kept in should be washed every
day. In winter the skunks lap up snow instead
of water.</p>
<h2 id="c11">11.&mdash;Examining Box.</h2>
<p>No cautious man would undertake to
examine a wild skunk as he would a dog
or rabbit. Yet it is important to know sex
and condition of each new skunk as it
arrives. This may be easily and quickly
done by means of an examining box. This
is a small box 10&Prime; by 8&Prime; by 6&Prime; covered with
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
a chicken wire of about one inch mesh on
the top. There should be a six inch entrance
at one end of the box.</p>
<p>On the solid wood bottom is a handle
which is of course the top, when the box
is turned wire side down.</p>
<p>Chase the skunk in the entrance slowly
and then lift the box up by the handle and
look under without fear. As soon as the
operation is over the skunk will seek his
proper den.</p>
<h2 id="c12">12.&mdash;Diseases.</h2>
<p>The keeper should watch the animal&rsquo;s
dung, if too fluid or too soft, too copious or
too little, there is something wrong. Their
appetite, and the dung are the great tests.
If these are right there is little chance of
anything being wrong.</p>
<p>Greed&mdash;Some cases often abound among
skunks such as over-eating; by getting all
they can from the other skunks, after eating
their own food. Such freaks should be
isolated and marketed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Cannibalism&mdash;Sometimes when enclosures
are small the mothers devour the young as
soon as born. This is sometimes the result
of quarreling. Always build the enclosures
large enough so the skunks have plenty of
room.</p>
<p>Murder&mdash;Murder must be considered a
disease. Some individuals are incapable of
it while others are very prone to it. The
last mentioned soon make themselves
known. They should be marketed as soon
as possible.</p>
<p>Distemper&mdash;This may be detected by the
animal&rsquo;s eyes and nose running. The animal
should be sent at once to the hospital, and
treated by washing the nose and eyes with
a solution of boric acid and water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Mange&mdash;Mange is considered a serious
disease, and is caused by fleas which induce
the animal to scratch. The fur gets thin
and the body is covered with scabs. This
may be cured by applying a good flea
powder and a dip.</p>
<p>Worms&mdash;Worms may be eliminated by
feeding the skunks in a dish of clear, sharp,
sand.</p>
<p>Other Foes&mdash;While the armed skunk travels
about without fear of man or beast, it
must be remembered that the disarmed
young skunks may be killed by dogs, or
taken by horned owls or any other large
bird.</p>
<h2 id="c13">13.&mdash;Rats.</h2>
<p>Rats are a great nuisance about a fur
ranch. They often dig holes and teach the
young skunks the way to escape. They also
kill the young, and are quick enough to keep
out of the way of the mother.</p>
<h2 id="c14">14.&mdash;Disinfectants.</h2>
<p>Those I use are&mdash;Chloride of lime, peroxide
of hydrogen, and lysol, 2%.</p>
<p>To disinfect a den, put it in a large tub
and soak it in &ldquo;sheep dip&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To disinfect a corner, sprinkle with chloride
of lime.</p>
<h2 id="c15">15.&mdash;Hospital.</h2>
<p>The hospital is a series of cages, quite
removed from the other, with the earth and
grass for a floor, and good opportunities
for a &ldquo;sun bath&rdquo;. Sick animals should be
put in the hospital as soon as noted.</p>
<h2 id="c16">16.&mdash;Breeding and Winter Management.</h2>
<p>The stock should be mated about November
or December. Put one male to four or
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
five females. It is well to watch them for
a few days to make sure the group is harmonious.
Often it happens that one female
will quarrel with the others.</p>
<p>She should be removed and tried somewhere
else. If one is seen outside the den
constantly, this is the cause.</p>
<p>Put plenty of straw in the den and they
will make themselves comfortable enough.</p>
<p>During the winter they eat nothing. Some
breeders deem it wise to feed a light meal a
week.</p>
<p>Mating time is from the middle of March,
starting with February. Males must not
meet at this time for they will fight, until
one or the other is killed.</p>
<h2 id="c17">17.&mdash;Barren Females.</h2>
<p>Three or four days after mating season
has set in, remove the male and try some
other male in, or for a few days. As the
males are decided in their likes and dislikes.
Neglect of this precaution will result in a
large proportion of barren females.</p>
<h2 id="c18">18.&mdash;Breeding Mothers.</h2>
<p>By April first every female should be
given a separate den, and well fed and cared
for.</p>
<p>This is the most important time of all,
success or failure depends on the management
of the mother at this time. Toward
the end of the month she should be given
raw meat and plenty of water. This diet
should be given until mid-May, as this allays
the meat craving which causes the mother
to devour the new-born young.</p>
<p>I will repeat again the watchwords of
success&mdash;</p>
<p>Proper sanitation, seclusion, and quiet,
an abundance of raw meat and fresh water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The period of gestation is nine weeks;
the young are born in mid-May.</p>
<p>The young females have from four to six
young the first litter and the older females
have from eight to sixteen to one litter.</p>
<p>Never put two females with young, in the
same house for they will fight and steal one
and anothers&rsquo; young.</p>
<p>One family in one house is a good old
rule to observe.</p>
<p>When one month old they are able to
walk around and drink milk. I would advise
disarming and weaning at this time.</p>
<h2 id="c19">19.&mdash;Young.</h2>
<p>The young grow very fast and soon become
as tame as kittens, some show their
amazing temper at this age, from the beginning.</p>
<p>At thirty days they walk alone and drink
milk. At sixty days they will weigh on the
average of six lbs. each, and appear to be
half grown. At six months they are full-grown,
and weigh from four to six lbs.</p>
<p>At this age they are ready to be marketed.</p>
<h2 id="c20">20.&mdash;Escapes.</h2>
<p>It is well to be prepared for escapes. A
properly constructed fence will prevent this.</p>
<p>Two contrivances should be in stock&mdash;net
and traps.</p>
<p>Net&mdash;This is an ordinary dip net to put
over them.</p>
<p>Traps&mdash;These are box traps, or &ldquo;catch-alives&rdquo;.
They are easily constructed, and
one half dozen will be found convenient for
many purposes.</p>
<h2 id="c21">21.&mdash;Disarming.</h2>
<p>To prevent a shot from this deadly battery
of the skunk they are disarmed while very
young. When animals are young the operation
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
is a simple one; but when performed
when they are grown not more than one out
of three survives the operation.</p>
<p>When ready for disarming, spread a burlap
or gunnysack across your lap and order
the assistant to bring the skunk. He must
be careful to hold it by the tail, with it
near the ground. The sack is then rolled
around the animal; rear exposed.</p>
<p>The assistant holds the animal firmly and
double muffles the eyes, so it cannot possibly
see. A skunk seldom shoots unless it
sees an enemy.</p>
<p>The proper instruments consist of a scalpel,
clamping forceps, extracting forceps,
hook and goggles.</p>
<p>The scent sacks are located one on each
side of the vent off one fourth inch from the
vent.</p>
<p>To disarm&mdash;First make an incision three
eighths of an inch long and one half an inch
from the vent.</p>
<p>As soon as the incision is made, cut
deeper until the scent sac appears, which
is about the size of a bean in young skunks
and about the size of a marble in mature
ones.</p>
<p>With the blunt forceps, force the adhering
muscles down off the sac, and cut the sac
off one fourth inch from the vent.</p>
<p>If the operation is done according to instructions,
there will be no loss whatever.</p>
<p>Animals do not require disarming unless
they are going to be shipped. If skunks
are raised solely for fur, it is just as well
to leave them armed.</p>
<p>Express companies refuse to ship them
unless scent sacks are removed.</p>
<h2 id="c22">22.&mdash;How to Ship Skunk.</h2>
<p>Secure them when ready for market, by
using a box-trap. Never try to handle
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>To ship them, put each in a small soap-box
lined with tin.</p>
<p>Cut a hole three inches square in the side
and cover it with wire of one inch mesh.</p>
<p>Fasten a tin in one corner of the box
three inches from the bottom for water.
Above this make a hole to pour water
through.</p>
<p>Mark it &ldquo;water here&rdquo;. Make a lid in the
box for convenience in feeding.</p>
<p>One pound of dog biscuits, or bread, and
a few scraps of meat will amply supply a
skunk on the road. Label the bag &ldquo;Seven
days food&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Do not fear to lift the lid and look in, for
a skunk must be greatly alarmed and provoked
before discharging musk.</p>
<h2 id="c23">Conclusion.</h2>
<p>If the material in this book is thoroughly
understood and mastered, and the reader
is the proud possessor of two &ldquo;star-black&rdquo;
skunks in a plot, fenced secure against
escape, in five years he can reap large dividends.</p>
